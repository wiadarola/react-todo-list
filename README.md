# React-TS-ToDo

Welcome to the React-TS-ToDo repository! This web app provides a basic to-do list functionality with a sleek user interface, designed with React and TypeScript. With data stored securely in your browser's local storage, your tasks stick around even after you've closed the tab!

## Features
- 🌟 **Full CRUD operations** on tasks.
- 💾 **Local storage integration** for task persistence.
- ⚙️ Built using **React & TypeScript** for robustness and scalability.
- 📱 **Responsive design** ensures usability across devices.

## Purpose
This project was born out of a personal initiative to get familiarized with React and TypeScript. As a precursor to a significant venture of transitioning tens of thousands of lines of code in my professional project from plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to a more robust React + TypeScript + Three.js environment, this repository serves as a testament to the learning journey and the foundational steps towards the bigger mission.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the development server using `npm start`.
4. Explore and add tasks to your heart's content!
